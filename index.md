## Welcome
---

Welcome to my CS-499 Capstone project.  I started the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University after over 20+ years in the Telecom/IT industry.  I entered the program with an associate’s degree in IT/Computer Network Systems, and a strong hardware and networking background, but with limited exposure to the software development aspect of computer science.  Courses such as CS-260 “Software Development Lifecycle”, and CS-320 “Software Test Automation”, provided a solid foundation for best software development practices.  Other courses, such as DAT-220” Fundamentals of Data Mining”, and CS-340 “Client/Server Development”, provided the fundamentals of database management, which I found the most intriguing for a future career opportunity outside the original network engineering path I originally entered the program with,  The capstone project will highlight my continued growth in software design discipline.  

The capstone project begins with the code review of the applications introduced previously in the curriculum, that will be the basis for the rest of the project.  Code review had been introduced in the CS-310 “Collaboration and Team Project” course.  The code review I have submitted will analyze the link list application, introduced in the CS-260 course of the curriculum.  This artifact will be the basis for all three enhancements in the project.  The code review will demonstrate my ability to collaborate in a team environment, as I analyze the code from another developer.  The review will break down the logic used by the original developer, as well as identify possible improvements.  This analysis could be used by the original developers to refine their work, or in this case can be used by a new developer to expand on the code.  The code review will also demonstrate my ability to communicate with stakeholders, as I define what enhancements will be made to the artifact over the course of the project.

The first enhancement will demonstrate my abilities in Software engineering.  The artifact used for this enhancement is the link list application introduced in the CS-260 “Data Structures and Algorithms” course.  This application takes data from a CSV file to create a link list.  This application was originally developed in C++.  One of the main disciplines in software engineering is the ability to translate an application into another language.  In the spirit of this aspect of the discipline, I have decided to port this application to Python.  Python is a language introduced in CS-200 “Computer Science’s Role in Industry”, that is widely considered one of the best languages for data analysis.   Enhancement one will present a nearly duplicate application of the original, coded in another language.

The second enhancement will continue to showcase my growth in the computer science field, as I improve on the python version of the link list application I created in the first enhancement.   This enhancement will improve minor functionality flaws identified in the original artifact, as well as introduce a new feature revolving around a data structure.  Enhancement two will introduce a save feature missing in the original artifact.  The new save feature will provide a mechanism for saving changes to the data set into a non-relational database.  The choice of using a protected database to save data over rewriting to a CSV demonstrates my ability to develop with a security first approach.

The third and final enhancement in the ePortfolio will demonstrate my abilities in the use and development of databases.  I have created a GUI, using Tkinter to provide an easy-to-use interface for manipulating and administering a MongoDB database.  The original artifact for this enhancement is the improved version of link list developed in the second enhancement.  This application will provide the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions, as well as provide a mechanism to read data from the original CSV file directly into the database, making the link list of the original application obsolete.  A mind set for security is also demonstrated in the future expansion of this application, as data encryption, login requirements, and MFA, while all disabled for demo purposes, provide for a much more robust security for the data.

## Code Review

<img src="./pics/code-review.png" style = "float: left; margin: 5px;" alt="Code Review"> The code review is an important aspect of software development.  Code reviews are used to provide positive scrutiny of anothers work.  Code reviews provide a mechanism to analyze code functionality, ensure use of good coding practices, identify potential coding errors, and finaly, suggest improvements for the project.  This code review will analyze an application introduced in the second year of the curriculum.  The app introduces the pros and cons of linked lists.  This artifact will be the main basis for all three of the enhancements outlined in this ePortfolio.  The artifact will be ported to Python in the first enhancement.  The second enhancement will introduce a new save function to the app, preserving data in a MongoDB database.  Finally the Third enhancement will remove the linked list functionality, and provide tools to manipulate the data directly in the database.

## Software Design and Engineering
---

<img src="./pics/software-engineering.png" style = "float: left; margin: 5px;" alt="Software Engineering">My first artifact originates from the course CS-260 “Data Structures and Algorithms”.  The third lab in this course examines the pros and cons of linked list structures.  The application reads a CSV file containing winning bids from fictional auctions and arranges the bids as nodes in a linked list.   The application continues to demonstrate the different ways to interact with a linked list including efficiently adding and removing nodes, inserting nodes in the middle of the list, and removing nodes without the need to rewrite the entire list.  The original artifact was created in the second year of the curriculum.

## Algorithm and Structures
---

<img src="./pics/algorithm.png" style = "float: left; margin: 5px;" alt="Algorithm and Data Structures"> The artifact for the second enhancement is a continuation of my work with the linked list application found in module three of CS260 “Data Structures and Algorithms”.  Instead of using the original version, however, I will be enhancing the Python version I created in the first artifact.  The original exercise was designed to focus on linked list capabilities.  I have added some functionality to the artifact that will point more toward database administration rather than linked lists.  One of the main features I noticed was missing was a method for storing the data once it’s manipulated.  I identified the choice between saving back to a csv file, or sav the data to a database.  I chose to create a method for saving the nodes to a MongoDB database for two reasons.  The first reason for my choice is based on security.  While csv files are invaluable for dumping large amounts of data into an application, they are not the most secure, being an unencrypted, clear text document.  The document structure of MongoDB database was a perfect match for the nodes that made up the linked list.  The database is also much more secure as it is hosted on a remote server, the access to the database is protected by MFA, and can be encrypted both in transit and in storage.  Some of the existing functions were also enhanced to mitigate some bugs.  An iteration was added to the load bids definition, for instance, that ensures no duplicates will be added to the link list.  Originally choosing load bids would parse the entire csv file into the linked list every time the option was chosen.  This would result in many unneeded nodes in the structure.  A similar enhancement was made to the “Enter a bid” option.  This option would allow a user to enter a duplicate bid ID, which in theory should be unique.  The major enhancement though was the new feature created to parse the link list and create documents for a MongoDB database.  A connection was made to a cloud instance of MongoDB, which is used for storage.

## Databases

<img src="./pics/non-relational.png" style = "float: left; margin: 5px;" alt="Databases">IThe artifact for the third enhancement is yet another continuation of my work with the linked list application found in module three of CS260 “Data Structures and Algorithms”.  In the second enhancement, there was a MongoDB database introduced to the link list application.  This database provided a way to remove and save bids to a more permanent structure than a linked list, which is lost when application is closed.   With the introduction of the database into the application, the linked list is no longer necessary.  The third enhancement involves eliminating the linked list from the application and replacing its functionality with database management tools, enabling direct addition, removal, and search operations within the database.   In addition to the database management functionality, a simple GUI was created using Tkinter, providing ease of use, and a little more sophistication to the artifact.
