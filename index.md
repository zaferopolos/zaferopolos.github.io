## Welcome
---

Welcome to my CS-499 Capstone project.  The 3 artifacts within this ePortfolio will demonstrate some of the core skills and knowledge gained from the Computer Science curriculum here at Southern New Hampshire University.  The first enhamcement will feature Software and Engineering skills, highlighting the ability to port an existing application to a new language.  The second enhancement will demonstrate my abilities in Algorithm and Data Structures, where a new feature of an existing application is identified and implemented.  The Third and Final enhancement will feature my database skills, where an interface to a manage a MongoDB database through a graphical interface created in Python.

## Code Review
---

<img src="./pics/code-review.png" style = "float: left; margin: 5px;" alt="Code Review"> The code review is an important aspect of software development.  Code reviews are used to provide positive scrutiny of anothers work.  Code reviews provide a mechanism to analyze code functionality, ensure use of good coding practices, identify potential coding errors, and finaly, suggest improvements for the project.  This code review will analyze an application introduced in the second year of the curriculum.  The app introduces the pros and cons of linked lists.  This artifact will be the main basis for all three of the enhancements outlined in this ePortfolio.  The artifact will be ported to Python in the first enhancement.  The second enhancement will introduce a new save function to the app, preserving data in a MongoDB database.  Finally the Third enhancement will remove the linked list functionality, and provide tools to manipulate the data directly in the database.

The application will be ported to the Python language.  Python is a natural language for a data driven app such as this.
